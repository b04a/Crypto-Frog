# Crypto-Frog

Project - Crypto Frog

Programming language - Swift

Framework, libraries - SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine

What the app does:
A fully functioning cryptocurrency tracking application. You can keep track of currencies purchased, sort the list, search by coin, and there is support with themes. In this project I touched on topics such as: 
- MVVM Architecture
- Core Data (saving current user's portfolio)
- FileManager (saving images)
- Combine (publishers and subscribers)
- Multiple API calls
- Codable (decoding JSON data)
- 100% SwiftUI interface
- Multi-threading (using background threads)
- Safe coding!!! ("if let" and "guard" statements to avoid crashes)
